Subset selection is the task of identifying a smaller subset of variables or features from a larger set that best represents the data or achieves a specific objective. The goal is to optimize an objective function while considering any constraints imposed on the selection process. Various algorithms and techniques, such as greedy algorithms, genetic algorithms, integer programming, and regularization methods, can be used to solve subset selection problems. It is a fundamental problem in optimization and machine learning with applications in feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model interpretability.
